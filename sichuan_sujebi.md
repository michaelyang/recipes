## Method
1. Combine dough ingredients into a stand mixer with dough hook and knead for about 3 minutes (or by hand for 10 minutes) until dough is firm enough to pick up.
2. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. ```Needs testing for chewier dough```
3. Add some dried kelp and 6 cups of water to a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium high heat.
(If using Hondashi, add 3 tsp to 6 cups of warm water, mix and set aside. Go to step 6.)
4. Once boiling, add some dried anchovies, turn down heat to low, let simmer for 10 minutes.
5. Take kelp and anchovies out and set the stock aside.
6. Crush the sichuan peppercorn using a mortar and pestle (or use ground sichuan peppercorn), add the red pepper flakes and set aside.
7. Heat up 2 Tbsp of oil in the same pot over medium heat.
8. Add the garlic and ginger to the oil.
9. Before the garlic turns brown (around 30 seconds), add the chili bean sauce and soy sauce then mix well.
10. After about a minute, add the stock back into the pot.
12. Once boiling, add potatoes and let simmer for about 8 minutes.
13. Add protein and simmer for about 2 minutes (until cooked).
14. Turn heat off, pour into individual serving bowls (or not).
15. Heat up 3 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a pan.
13. Sprinkle the crushed sichuan peppercorn and red pepper flakes on each bowl.
14. Once the oil is hot, pour oil onto the peppercorn and pepper flakes.
15. Top with sliced scallion.
